      label: Describe the feature you'd like to request
      description: Please describe the feature as clear and concise as possible. Remember to add context as to why you believe this feature is needed.
      placeholder: I would like to request the addition of a dark mode theme for the website. Currently, the website only supports a light theme, and I believe adding a dark mode option would greatly enhance the user experience, especially for users who prefer dark interfaces.

      description: Please describe the solution you would like to see. Adding example usage is a good way to provide context.
      placeholder: I envision the dark mode theme to have a dark color palette with high contrast. It should be easy on the eyes and provide a pleasant browsing experience in low-light conditions. It would be great if the website could remember the user's preference and automatically switch between light and dark mode based on their system settings.
