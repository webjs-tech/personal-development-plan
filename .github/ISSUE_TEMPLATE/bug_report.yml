        I tested my reproduction against different canary releases, and the first one that introduced the bug was "13.4.20-canary.13", since reverting to "13.4.20-canary.12" works.

        or

        I am hosting via Docker with the recommended `output: "standalone"` option", and if I remove that option or try a different hosting option, I cannot reproduce the same issue.
